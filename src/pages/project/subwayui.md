準備中

<!-- ## It's the alcohol.
I don't know what I was thinking, but that night after a few drinks, I suddenly felt the urge to make something.
Drinking, watching movies, and coding are my main ways to spend my weekends.
For a long time, I've wanted to create a user interface that was rich in my own ideas, from design to coding.
And finally, with the help of alcohol, the project was off and running.

I live in Tokyo, Japan, and I usually take the train when I go out, but I often lose track of where I am going when I change trains.
At that time, the wayfinding system will be checked.
The wayfinding system is an excellent way for most people to quickly see and identify their destination.
Important letters and icons are designed to be large enough for you to see and continue walking without stopping.
